# Pig Game

## Description

Welcome to Pig Game! This project is a simple dice game where two players compete to reach 100 points first. Players take turns rolling a single die as many times as they wish, accumulating points for each roll. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during their turn, and the turn passes to the other player. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Player 1 begins the game.
2. **Roll the Die**: On your turn, roll the die by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
3. **Accumulate Points**: Each roll adds points to your current turn's score unless you roll a 1.
4. **Hold or Continue**:
   - **Hold**: Click the "Hold" button to add your turn's points to your total score and pass the turn to the other player.
   - **Continue Rolling**: Keep rolling to accumulate more points, but risk rolling a 1 and losing all points for that turn.
5. **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
